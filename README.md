# Building (Windows x64)
Nuvola uses CMake and Git alone for dependency management. Ensure you have git installed before building. ***You must clone the repository to be able to build!!***

## Requirements
There are many things needed to properly build Nuvola.

1. Git - Its required to clone & update submodules
2. CMake - CMake is used to generate the files for MSVC to build the project
3. Visual Studio - Visual Studio provides the compilers we need.
    - C++ Desktop development
    - .NET framework development

## Building
To build it, simply use CMake to generate the project cache, which includes downloading necessary dependencies. After that is complete, you can use CMake to build. If you are using Visual Studio or CLion, this should be done for you.
